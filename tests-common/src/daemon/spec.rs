//! What a test daemon is configured with, as data (issue [#634]).
//!
//! [`bring_up_daemon`](super::bring_up_daemon) used to take six
//! positional arguments, four of them `&str` in two adjacent pairs.
//! **Three** integration tests carried a hand-rolled copy of it
//! instead, ~70 identical lines each:
//!
//! * `observation_capture` wanted a seventh, eighth and ninth value — a
//!   real LLM model, an operator-supplied timeout, and a 15 s readiness
//!   budget;
//! * `guard_boot_row_e2e` wanted a 20 s budget and the four
//!   `KASTELLAN_LLM_GUARD_*` keys;
//! * `cli_ask_e2e` wanted **nothing the shared helper lacked** — its one
//!   divergence, the `KASTELLAN_SHELL_EXEC_BIN` registration, was
//!   already exactly what the old `extra_env` parameter carried for
//!   `cli_memory_l3_run_daemon_e2e`. It was duplication for no reason at
//!   all, which is the sharper half of the argument.
//!
//! What that costs is visible in [#635], which had to write one
//! stderr-on-failure fix **twice** — once in this shared helper and once
//! in `guard_boot_row_e2e`'s copy — while `cli_ask_e2e`'s and
//! `observation_capture`'s copies never received it at all and kept
//! reporting a dead daemon as its last polled status.
//!
//! So the parameters became a struct. The point is not brevity: it is
//! that a builder call names every value at the call site, which the
//! positional form did not. Transposing two adjacent `&str` arguments
//! compiles in silence — the same hazard
//! [#632](https://github.com/hherb/kastellan/issues/632) was filed
//! about one crate over.
//!
//! **The transform is pure.** Nothing here creates a directory,
//! installs a unit or opens a socket; [`DaemonSpec::service_spec`] turns
//! a spec plus three already-existing paths into a
//! [`ServiceSpec`](kastellan_supervisor::ServiceSpec) and nothing else.
//! The one exception is [`DaemonSpec::new`], which reads the clock and
//! `$USER` **once** to derive the values #641 removed from its
//! signature — deliberately eagerly, so that everything downstream is a
//! pure function of stored data.
//! That is what lets the assertions below run as `tests-common` unit
//! tests — the only target in `linux-check.yml` that covers this code,
//! where the daemon e2es these values feed are DGX-gated and run on no
//! PR at all.
//!

        // the winner is decided by the *renderer*: systemd emits one
        // `Environment=` line each and documents last-wins, but launchd
        // emits a plist dict with a duplicate key, whose resolution the
        // plist format does not define. Nothing in `kastellan-supervisor`
        // tests either, so the guarantee `env` makes — and that
        // `force_routing(false)`, a containment control, depends on —
        // would be a belief about `CFPropertyList` on one of the two
        // first-class platforms.
        //
        // Collapsing here makes the rendered unit unambiguous on both,
        // and preserves the documented semantics exactly: the value kept
        // is the one last-wins would have chosen. The general question —
        // any other `ServiceSpec` producer passing duplicate keys — is
        // #644.
