//! Unit tests for [`DaemonSpec`] (issue #634).
//!
//! Hermetic and pure — no directory is created, no unit is installed, no
//! socket is opened. That matters more here than it usually does:
//! `linux-check.yml` runs `cargo test -p kastellan-tests-common` on every
//! PR, and it is the only target there that reaches this code — the
//! **six** daemon e2es these values configure are DGX-gated and run on no
//! PR at all. So this file is the only CI coverage the bring-up contract
//! has.
