//! Lenient parse of an LLM response into a [`Plan`].
//!
//! The agent's `RouterAgent::formulate_plan` originally called
//! `serde_json::from_str` directly on the LLM's raw response. That works
//! when the model emits bare JSON, but most instruction-tuned local
//! models wrap their output in a ```json … ``` markdown fence by default
//! (gemma4, Qwen3 with thinking off, llama3 instruct, etc.). Prompt
//! engineering can usually suppress the fence, but the suppression is
//! advisory — at observation time we still see captures where the model
//! ignores the directive — and the cost of being tolerant is low.
//!
//! The contract is:
//!
//! 1. **Strict path first.** If the input is already a single bare JSON
//!    value, parse it directly so the audit-log byte-for-byte shape of
//!    successful calls is unchanged. The strict path is the same code
//!    `serde_json::from_str` ran before this module existed; the
//!    lenient extraction only kicks in when strict parsing fails.
//! 2. **Lenient path on failure.** Find the first `{` in the input and
//!    let `serde_json::Deserializer::from_str(...).into_iter::<Plan>()`
//!    consume the first complete JSON value starting at that offset.
//!    Surrounding prose (model preamble, ```json fence opener, trailing
//!    explanations after the closing brace) is ignored.
//! 3. **No partial-recovery JSON repair.** We don't patch unbalanced
//!    braces, smart-quotes, or trailing commas. If the model's JSON is
//!    structurally broken, the error surfaces to the agent loop as
//!    `AgentError::Decode` (same surface as the strict path) and the
//!    inner loop counts it as a failed plan iteration.
//! 4. **First `{` wins.** The lenient path anchors on the *first* `{`
//!    in the input. If a model emits prose that contains a `{`
//!    character *before* the real JSON body (e.g. "expected shape is
//!    `{tool, method, params}`: ```json\n{…real plan…}\n```"), the
//!    stream-deserializer will try to parse from that earlier `{`,
//!    fail, and the decode fails. The failure mode is "fail decode →
//!    failed plan iteration", never "succeed with the wrong JSON value
//!    picked from later in the response".
//! 5. **The reported error describes the failure that matters.** When
//!    the input contains no `{` at all it cannot be JSON, and the
//!    strict-path error ("expected value at line 1 column 1") is the
//!    honest description. When the input *does* contain a `{`, the
//!    lenient path's error is the informative one — "missing field
//!    `steps`", "invalid type", a position — and it is what callers
//!    see.
//!
//!    **Read those positions against the anchor, not the response.** A
//!    lenient error's `line`/`column` are computed over `&raw[first_brace..]`,
//!    so "line 1 column 12" indexes the JSON body, not the model output
//!    an operator is scrolling through — a fenced plan's first line of
//!    JSON is line 1 here but line 2 there. In practice only the
//!    brace-less case reports positions in the whole input, because
//!    there the strict path produced them. (The `None` arm of the
//!    stream-deserializer falls back to the strict error too, but it is
//!    unreachable: the slice always begins with the `{` we anchored on,
//!    so the iterator always yields a value or an error, never nothing.)
//!
//!    An earlier version re-emitted the *strict* error in both cases,
//!    for "a stable error type". That was actively harmful: a model
//!    returning a well-formed fenced plan that merely omitted a
//!    required field was reported as `expected value at line 1 column
//!    1`, i.e. "your output wasn't JSON" — pointing every reader at the
//!    fence instead of the field. It cost a full live debugging session
//!    on the DGX before the raw output was captured and the real error
//!    (`missing field 'steps'`) became visible.
