//! Delivering a raised ask to the conversation its task came from.
//!
//! **Sync and separable**, deliberately: the decision (where does this go,
//! and did it get there?) and the audit row it produces are both separated
//! from the `await`ing emitter in [`super::lifecycle`]. Not *pure* —
//! `deliver_ask` pushes into a live queue via `ChannelOutbox::try_deliver`,
//! which is the whole observable effect; only `delivery_audit_row` is a
//! pure function. That is what lets every
//! branch below — including all three failure branches — have a unit test,
//! on a path whose async half needs a live Postgres.
//!
//! **Delivery never fails the ask** (spec D2). By the time anything here
//! runs, `db::asks::raise` has committed: the ask is durable and the task
//! is suspended. A Matrix outage must not turn into a task failure on the
//! one path where the reviewer said a human must decide.
//!
//! Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-ask-channel-slice-2-design.md`.
