//! Core-initiated outbound: the seam that lets code outside the bus send a
//! message on a channel.
//!
//! The bus is otherwise strictly *inbound message → task → reply on
//! completion*, so nothing in core could start a conversation — which is
//! why `Verdict::Escalate` could raise a durable question that reached only
//! `kastellan-cli inbox`.
//!
//! **Why a registry and not a `Sender`.** The scheduler is spawned before
//! the channel supervisors, and each supervisor *restarts* its bus (#514,
//! #517). So the scheduler cannot hold a sender the bus owns: it does not
//! exist yet at scheduler spawn, and any sender it held would go stale on
//! the next respawn. This is the indirection both sides share — `main`
//! creates it before either, the bus registers into it on every bring-up,
//! and a stale entry surfaces as [`OutboxError::QueueClosed`] rather than a
//! message that quietly disappears.
//!
//! Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-ask-channel-slice-2-design.md`.
