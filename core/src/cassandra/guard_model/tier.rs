//! The production guard tier: the arm logic, the threshold validation,
//! and the boot sequence that assembles them (wiring-spec D1/D4/D6/D8/D9).
//!
//! # The shape, and what each door costs
//!
//! ```text
//! catalogue >= BLOCK_THRESHOLD  ->  Block, model NOT consulted
//! catalogue <  BLOCK_THRESHOLD  ->  guard configured?
//!                                     no  -> Allow (reported at BOOT, not per dispatch)
//!                                     yes -> any scannable text?
//!                                              no  -> Allow, audited (NoScannableText)
//!                                              yes -> probability()
//!                                                       Err(..)     -> Allow, audited (RouterError)
//!                                                       Unmeasured  -> Allow, audited (Unmeasured)
//!                                                       Flagged     -> Block
//!                                                       Clear       -> Allow
//! ```
//!
//! The `no` row is annotated deliberately: an unconfigured tier is
//! reported **once** by the `policy / guard_tier.boot` row and emits no
//! per-dispatch field at all, so reading that row as a dispatch-time
//! audit would send someone looking for a row that is never written.
//! See [`Unadjudicated::NotConfigured`].
//!
//! **Escalate-up only.** The model can turn an `Allow` into a `Block`
//! and never the reverse, so every failure mode of this tier is at
//! worst today's catalogue-only behaviour. That is the whole safety
//! argument, and it is why the `Err(..)` door fails *open* even though
//! an attacker can reach it (wiring-spec D8: fail-closed would let
//! anyone who can serve the agent a web page deny it every document by
//! padding one).
//!
//! # What this tier is, and is not
//!
//! Measurement 3 fitted τ = 0.79552656 on 133 cases, 109 of them
//! captured through the real `web.fetch` path. At that threshold the
//! tier catches **36 of 55 attacks — 65% recall** at an FP-0 threshold,
//! and the misses concentrate exactly where its rationale is
//! strongest: bare imperative payloads are caught 6/6 at a median
//! 0.9955, while the same intent wrapped in a plausible document runs a
//! median 0.0797 with 5 of 8 missed.
//!
//! **"FP-0" is the criterion that CHOSE τ, not a measured
//! false-positive rate.** τ was fitted and evaluated on the same 133
//! cases, so zero false positives there is guaranteed by construction.
//! What the number on an unseen corpus would be is unknown — which is
//! part of why D5 records `p` on cleared documents in production.
//!
//! **So this is advisory defence-in-depth, not a gate**, and nothing
//! downstream may relax on it: no catalogue weight is lowered because
//! the model is watching, no allowlist widened, no sandbox constraint
//! loosened. See D10.
