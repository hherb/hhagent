/// Why the guard tier could not be built.

/// **Every variant stops the daemon** (wiring-spec D6). The
/// counter-argument — a down daemon protects nothing — was weighed and
/// rejected: "loud error at boot" is precisely the thing that gets
/// scrolled past, and the failure being guarded against is *silent
/// deactivation of a security control*.
///
/// **What these variants do NOT cover, and why [`Self::Required`]
/// exists.** The hazard D6 cites by name is `kastellan-cli install`
/// regenerating `kastellan.env` and dropping hand-added keys — but a
/// regeneration drops *every* hand-added key, not one of a pair, so the
/// realistic outcome is all three guard keys gone. That lands on
/// [`GuardTier::from_router_config`]'s `Ok(None)` arm, which is the one
/// arm that is **not** fatal: the daemon boots clean and screens with
/// the catalogue alone. The variants below cover a *half*-drop;
/// `install`'s own `env_diff` covers the full one; and an operator who
/// wants the control to be load-bearing sets `KASTELLAN_REQUIRE_GUARD=1`

/// timeout. That is a fail-open, and it would show up as nothing at
/// all.
///
/// **A connect timeout is excluded, and the exclusion is the whole
/// reason this is not a one-liner.** `reqwest::Error::is_timeout` walks
/// the source chain for `io::ErrorKind::TimedOut`, and a *connect*
/// timeout puts one there — so `is_timeout()` and `is_connect()` are
/// **both** true for it. `Router::with_policy` caps connect at 5 s
/// independently of the request budget, so without this clause a
/// transient 5 s connect stall on a perfectly fast host would be read
/// as [`ProbeOutcome::Saturated`]: derive the 120 s ceiling, fire the
/// "this host cannot adjudicate a worst-case document" warning, and
/// write a throughput nobody measured into `policy / guard_tier.boot`.
///
/// The two errors mean opposite things. A request timeout says *the
/// backend is slow*, which is a measurement. A connect timeout says
/// *the backend was not reachable*, which says nothing about its
/// throughput and must take the floor with every other failure.

/// **Defined through [`error_kind::classify`] rather than re-deriving

/// `classify_transport` answering the *same* question about the *same*
/// reqwest pair two different ways, ~300 lines apart, with nothing able
/// to notice — the audit row said `timeout` where this said "not a
/// timeout". Now there is one classification and two readings of it:
/// [`GuardErrorKind::ConnectTimeout`] is a distinct arm, and this asks
/// only for the request-budget one. Reordering the classifier can no
/// longer silently change what the probe measures.
