//! What the daemon records about the guard tier at boot (issue [#627]).
//!
//! One boot produces one `info!` line, at most one `warn!`, and one
//! durable `policy / guard_tier.boot` audit row. All three report the
//! same facts, and until this module existed all three were built inline
//! in `core/src/main.rs` — a binary crate with no `#[cfg(test)]` module,
//! so the only tests naming that row asserted its **count**.
//!
//! That gap mattered because half of [#624]'s fix lives in the *report*
//! rather than in the probe. Taking the fastest of several samples is
//! worth nothing if the row cannot then distinguish a quiet host from a
//! busy one — and swapping [`BootRates::fastest_tok_per_s`] with
//! [`BootRates::slowest_tok_per_s`] **silences** the documented operator
//! query `slowest_tok_per_s < tok_per_s / 2`.
//!
//! Note the failure mode, because it is worse than an inversion and the
//! obvious guess is wrong. A swap does *not* make quiet hosts report as
//! busy: since `slowest <= fastest` always holds, a swapped row asks
//! `fastest < slowest / 2`, which no row can satisfy. The query returns
//! the **empty set on every host, forever** — a contended host stops
//! reporting as contended and nothing takes its place. Every key set,
//! type and non-null survives that mutation, so only a test that reads
//! the two values back can catch it.
//!
//! **Pure throughout** — no tier, no pool, no clock, no backend. The two
//! scalars and the budget [`boot_payload`] takes are its whole input
//! apart from [`super::policy::policy_digest`], and taking them rather
//! than a `&GuardTier` is the whole point: a `GuardTier` has no
//! constructor but [`super::GuardTier::from_router_config`], whose
//! `/props` verification is fatal — so building one in a unit test would
//! need a live guard endpoint. That is why this code was unreachable
//! from a unit test in the first place.

///
/// Every field is an `Option` because every one of them is genuinely
/// absent on some basis, and absence must reach the row as JSON `null`
/// rather than as a fabricated `0`: a wedged backend really can measure
/// `0.0` tok/s, so a zero standing in for "never measured" would be
/// indistinguishable from an observation.
///
/// ⚠️ That contract depends on a guard **this module does not hold**.
/// `serde_json` maps a non-finite float to `null` rather than erroring,
/// so a `NaN` or infinite rate would reach the row as `"tok_per_s":
/// null` — indistinguishable from "never measured", which is the exact
/// confusion the `Option` exists to prevent. It cannot happen today
/// because [`super::timeout::derive_guard_timeout`] rejects a
/// non-finite rate before any `Probed` basis is built, and that is the
/// only production constructor of one.
///
/// The fields are `pub` within the crate and nothing here enforces
/// `slowest <= fastest` — that repair belongs to
/// [`super::timeout::derive_guard_timeout`], which builds the basis and
/// applies `.min(fastest)` as it does. (Not to [`super::timeout::summarise`],

/// function produced; `TimeoutBasis`'s own fields are `pub`, so a
/// hand-built one — including every fixture in this module's tests —
/// carries whatever it was given. This type reports what the basis says;
/// it does not re-decide it.

///   rotate; `audit_log` does not. It is passed straight through from
