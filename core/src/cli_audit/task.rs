///    `task.<state>` rows so observation-phase SQL on
///    `action LIKE 'task.%'` captures both producer intent and

/// 2. **Only when no scheduler-side observer will finalize the task**:
///    one `actor='cli' action='task.finalize'` summary row with
///    `state='cancelled'`, `started_at: null`, and zero counters /
///    duration. Rationale: without this row observation-phase SQL
///    grouping on `action='task.finalize'` would silently undercount by
///    exactly the population no observer covers. The counters
///    are **known** zeros (the task ran zero plan iterations and zero
///    step dispatches) — distinct from the crashed-task finalize where
///    they are JSON `null` because the dead daemon's counters were
///    unrecoverable.
/// 3. **When the cancel destroyed pending asks**: one `actor='cli'
///    action='ask.cancelled'` row (#564), so a withdrawn human question
///    leaves a trace.
///

/// [`scheduler_will_emit_finalize`]. Only a task cancelled out of
/// `running` has a live inner loop whose `observe_state` poll will write
/// the scheduler's own finalize row; emitting a producer finalize for it
/// too would double-count. A task cancelled out of `pending` was never
/// claimed, and one cancelled out of `awaiting_operator` was claimed but
/// has no live loop — both need the producer row.
