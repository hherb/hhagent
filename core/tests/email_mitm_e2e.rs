//! Hermetic MITM round-trip for the **email fallback channel** (#494 slice 1):
//! the real `kastellan-worker-email-in` binary, under the real platform jail,
//! force-routed through a real intercepting egress sidecar, polling a
//! **self-signed HTTPS** localmail mock.
//!
//! This is the leg that did not exist before this branch. Slice 1's sidecar was
//! a transparent tunnel: the worker terminated TLS itself against the origin,
//! its `web-common` client trusts webpki roots only, and so a self-signed
//! localmail — the only kind a personal deployment has — was flatly unreachable
//! by this channel. Interception moves the origin handshake into the sidecar,
//! where the operator's anchor (`KASTELLAN_EGRESS_UPSTREAM_EXTRA_CA`, #492) can
//! widen trust for exactly that one private origin.
//!
//! Everything earlier in the branch is proved at the policy-construction level
//! (`channel::email`'s own tests capture the sidecar `SandboxPolicy` and assert
//! the anchor reached its env). Those prove the *wiring*. This file is the only
//! place that proves the wiring **works** — that bytes actually cross a
//! re-originated TLS connection the anchor validated.
//!
//! Skips as-pass when the sandbox or a required binary is missing; no Postgres
//! is involved (the channel path is DB-free — `audit_ack_only` is `None` here).
